PromiseLand is a Instagram liked Web3 Native social dapp where u

### Problem Statement

- The traditional social media platform where the content creators are hard to get rewarded if they created some viral content if they are not sponsored. Overall, they are hard to get paid for creating popular content.
- For the content creators’ followers, if they are elderly supporters, they are hard to share the success of the content creator they supported gets successful.

### Proposed Solution

- PromiseLand is built for content creators and their fans. Content creators can create their work most likely pictures as NFT to their own NFT collections. They can upload any images they want including their artwork, photograph, or just a selfie as NFT which is stored permanently in blockchain and IPFS. Their NFT can be traded and liked on our platform.
- But not only content creators can be benefited by selling their digital content as NFT. Their fans can also be rewarded by liking their favorite content. The earlier they like the NFT, they will get a higher reward after the NFT gets sold.

## How it works

In PromiseLand, any user with a crypto wallet can post their favorite image like digital art, photograph, or even memes in PromiseLand as "NFT" with only the cost of a gas fee. The user's supporter can like their favorite content by clicking like button to the NFT post with a small tip. When the NFT post got sold, all the tips will be transferred to the seller and likers can earn some shares from the sale using our promiseland smart contract.
